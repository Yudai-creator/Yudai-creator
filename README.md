### I'm a web developer, breaking into UI/UX design, currently living in Cuba. Passionate about animations on the web, love creating little animations to increase users experience. Love designing UIs, lets me develop my creativiy. I build my projects using the JAMStack, with Nuxt and SASS on board, yes I like doing my own CSS 😁
